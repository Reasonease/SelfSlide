SelfSlide
=========

Slider-In-Progress. Currently running 700px height: adjust but please help to create a non-dependent slider on anything. The current slider is not dependent on any outside files but a Respond.min.js, a responsive framework CSS, a slide CSS and a slide JS. This I am hoping will be the first non-dependent slider around which is responsive.
